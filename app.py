# GAME OBJECT HERE #

    # resets guessedLetters
    # resets guessesRemaining
    # call getWord?

    # instantiate your word class and store it in this object?
    # prompt (using DOM) user to start guessing, or call another method that does this

    # update/display guessed letters
    # update/display guesses remaining
        # perhaps?  

  
  # what else?
  # some kind of functionality to have game end in loss if they run out of guesses?
  # and to have game end in a win if they guess all the letters correctly?
